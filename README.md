- 👋 Hi, I’m @ccbagel. I'm a Fullstack/iOS developer based in Toronto & Calgary. I specialize in proof-of-concepts, prototypes, and UX/UI. However, I'm more passionate about the backend since I'm more of a logical developer and not a designer. I tend to enjoy building out APIs, servers and databases 🏗️
- 🧰 Tools I currently use are: React & Redux, NodeJS & Express, MongoDB & Firestore, NextJS, Postman, StorybookJS, Figma, Rails, CircleCI, Lighthouse, UiKit/MaterialUi, GraphQL, Jest, Docker & AWS.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced iOS development 📱, building scalable microservices in Java 🤏, React Testing Framework 🧪, Typescript, NextJS 🔥 and more. 
- 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects that make an impact. Or pretty much anything else to be honest 
- 🌐 Languages I speak: JavaScript/TypeScript, Swift, Ruby, Java, C#
