- 👋 Hi, I’m @ccbagel. I'm a software developer.
- 🧰 Tools I currently use are: React, NextJS, MongoDB, NodeJS, Express, and a lot more.
- 🌱 I want to learn Flutter & React Native next. 
- 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects that make an impact. Or pretty much anything else to be honest 🤷🏽‍♂️
- 🌐 Languages I speak: JavaScript, Swift, C, Python,  SQL, and some Java, although I mostly use Javascript for React & React Native.
